# ObserverPatternDemo
The project is a WinForm that demonstrates Observer Pattern.
It has a main form that updates data through a textbox and when the update button is clicked it updates the data in all those two forms controls if those forms subscribe to it. 
On clicking the unsubscribe button on these forms they unsubscribe from the main form, so that they no more receive any updates from it. 

Have fun coding!
